# STOCK PRICE PREDICTION USING MACHINE LEARNING
A machine learning model for stock price prediction, incorporating various factors influencing market volatility.Utilized machine learning techniques including LSTM and GRU models along with ARIMA, SARIMAX
to conduct a comparative analysis of the results obtained from each model to determine their effectiveness in predicting stock market trends.

Considering the past stock price as the final manifestation of all impacting factors we employ Machine Learning (ML) techniques
on historical stock price data to infer future trend. ML techniques have the potentialto unearth patterns and insights we didnâ€™t see before, and these can be used to make
unerringly accurate predictions.
